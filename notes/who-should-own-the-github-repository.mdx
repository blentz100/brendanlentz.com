## Owning the Title Isn’t the Same as Holding the Keys

I was speaking with a founder recently who wasn't happy with the performance of his software vendor. He had concerns
about any risks he might have if he ended the relationship.

He felt confident that we was in control of the IP because he had that covered in his services contract. I said
that's good but it's not enough.

He needed help understanding why.

I knew that his source code lived in a repository that his vendor owned.

I explained it like this: You probably have the title to the car you drove here today. You are the legal
owner of the car. Now you decide to give the car and keys to someone else, and they decide to keep it stored in
their garage. You are
trusting that they'll give you the car back when you ask for it. Maybe they will, maybe they won't. Maybe they will
stop taking your calls, and you have no idea where your car is anymore. You still own it,
but now might have to resort to litigation to try to recover your car. It's essentially of no
value to you anymore because you can't use it.

You might own it.

But can you drive it?

And if you can't drive it, does it have any value to you?

I've had conversations like this more than once. Founders and business owners doesn't always understand what it means
to own the accounts where your source control lives. Or their database, or other critical infrastructure.

## Contracts Protect You. Control Empowers You.

Contracts are essential. They define ownership, expectations, and recourse if things go wrong.

But contracts don’t:

- Give you admin access

- Guarantee immediate availability

- Prevent operational disruption

- Avoid operational slowdowns during transitions

Control lives in systems and permissions, not just language in a PDF.

If you have to ask someone else for access to your own production systems, you don’t truly control them.

## Own the Accounts. Grant the Access.

As a founder or business owner:

**You create and own the core accounts.**

**You grant access to vendors and contractors.**

Not the other way around.

That includes:

- Source control (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

- Cloud hosting (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure)

- Domain names (Network Solutions, GoDaddy, Cloudflare Registrar)

- DNS (Google Public DNS, OpenDNS, Cloudflare)

- Email services

- Payment processors

- Analytics

- Third-party APIs

If it runs your business, it should be in your name, billed to you, and controlled by you.

Vendors should be collaborators — not gatekeepers.

## Why This Matters More Than You Think

When the vendor owns the infrastructure: offboarding becomes messy, disputes become risky, transitions become
expensive, leverage shifts away from you, and continuity depends on goodwill.

Even if everyone is acting in good faith, structural dependency creates fragility.

And fragility shows up at the worst possible times — funding rounds, acquisitions, vendor disputes, or leadership changes.


## The Simple Control Checklist

If you're building or relying on existing software, ask yourself:

- Do we own the repository?

- Do we have admin access to our hosting environment?

- Is the domain registered under our name?

- Do we control DNS?

- Are core services billed directly to us?

- Could we replace our current vendor tomorrow if we had to?

If any of those answers is “no,” you don’t fully control your technology stack — even if your contract says you own the IP.

The least expensive time to fix these problems is right now. The longer you ignore it, more complex things become
and the harder it will be to transition.

## Final Thought

I've seen founders get burned enough times with this kind of thing I wanted to write out it. Hopefully this helps
founders avoid the worst outcomes around controlling your IP.

Ownership is legal.

Control is operational.

Both matter — but only one determines whether you can move fast, pivot, or survive disruption.

Make sure you’re not just holding the title.

Make sure you’re holding the keys.

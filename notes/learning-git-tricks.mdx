My very first commit to Github.com was on May 27th, 2020. Github technically counts it as a commit, but it was done via Github's
file upload feature. At that time I wasn't comfortable enough with running git on the command line. Since then, I've pushed
over 900 commits to GitHub. I've learned a few tricks over that many repetitions and I'd like to share one of my favorites.

When you create a new repo, GitHub offers some helper commands to get you
started but it doesn't explain what each command does. I want to explain a bit
more what each of the commands above does and offer some ways to verify each step.

## Step 1 - Create a new file

```bash session
➜  TestRepo ls -al
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   2 blentz  staff   64 Jul  8 16:01 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 20 blentz  staff  640 Jul  8 14:52 ..
➜  TestRepo echo "# Test-Repository" >> README.md
➜  TestRepo ls -al
total 8
drwxr-xr-x   3 blentz  staff   96 Jul  8 16:01 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 20 blentz  staff  640 Jul  8 14:52 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 blentz  staff   18 Jul  8 16:01 README.md
➜  TestRepo
```

`echo` is a command line utility that will take some string as input and output
it somewhere else. You are combining the `echo` command with the
the redirect `>>` shell operator. In this case you are redirecting the string `# Test-Repository` to a file named `README.md` The reasoning behind this is so that
you have some file to work with in your repository when you are just starting.
You'll need a file in place in order for the rest of the commands to make any
sense, and this one command is kind of a quick shortcut to ensure you have a
file to work with.

If you are new to working on the command line, don't worry too much about things
like the `echo` command and the `>>` redirect operator. You'll have time later
to learn more about those, for now stick with git. Onto step 2...

## Step 2 - Initialize a git repo

```bash session
➜  TestRepo git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/blentz/GithubRepos/TestRepo/.git/
➜  TestRepo git:(main) ✗ ls -al
total 8
drwxr-xr-x   4 blentz  staff  128 Jul  9 18:10 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 20 blentz  staff  640 Jul  8 14:52 ..
drwxr-xr-x   9 blentz  staff  288 Jul  9 18:10 .git
-rw-r--r--   1 blentz  staff   18 Jul  8 16:01 README.md
➜  TestRepo git:(main) ✗
```

## Step 3 - Stage files for a commit

```bash session
➜  TestRepo git:(main) ✗ git add README.md
➜  TestRepo git:(main) ✗ git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README.md

➜  TestRepo git:(main) ✗
```

## Step 4 - Execute the commit

```bash session
➜  TestRepo git:(main) ✗ git commit -m "first commit"
[main (root-commit) 14690ab] first commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
➜  TestRepo git:(main) git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
➜  TestRepo git:(main)
```

## Step 5 - Set your branch

```bash session
➜  TestRepo git:(main) git branch -M main
➜  TestRepo git:(main) git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
➜  TestRepo git:(main)
```

## Step 6 - Connect to your remote

```bash session
➜  TestRepo git:(main) git remote
➜  TestRepo git:(main) git remote add origin https://github.com/blentz100/Test-Repository.git
➜  TestRepo git:(main) git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/blentz100/Test-Repository.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/blentz100/Test-Repository.git (push)
➜  TestRepo git:(main)

```

## Step 7 Push to Github

```bash session

```

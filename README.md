This is my personal homepage which I use to experiment with different technologies. Most recently I've been using it to work on my Habit Tracker - which I've used to help me do over 10,000 pushups in a year.

Site Credit: I originally forked this project from Jake Jarvis. I liked his design and the fact that he was using a bunch of different technologies to experiment with. I've learned alot from adding onto and modifying his original [project](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is). Thanks Jake!
